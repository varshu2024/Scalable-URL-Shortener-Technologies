# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 16/8/2024

## Introduction

I am committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and safeguard the information you provide when using my URL Shortener API. By using this service, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this policy.

## Information I Collect

### 1. IP Addresses
   - **Purpose:** IP addresses are collected to ensure the security and proper functioning of the API, particularly for monitoring and limiting the number of requests (rate limiting).
   - **Usage:** IP addresses are logged to prevent abuse of the service by identifying and blocking excessive or unauthorized access attempts.
   - **Storage:** IP addresses are securely stored in my database and are not publicly accessible.
   - **Retention:** IP addresses are retained only as long as necessary to enforce rate limiting and security protocols, typically for 2 weeks.

### 2. Location Data
   - **Purpose:** Location data derived from IP addresses helps me understand the geographic distribution of users. This insight allows me to optimize the service and improve user experience.
   - **Usage:** Location data is shared with users when they request information about their short URL and is also used for analytical purposes to enhance the service.
   - **Storage:** Location data is anonymized and aggregated to ensure it cannot be used to identify individual users. This aggregated data may be stored indefinitely for analysis and reporting.
   - **Retention:** Anonymized and aggregated location data may be retained indefinitely for analytical purposes.

## How I Protect Your Information

Your data's security is important to me. I implement industry-standard measures to protect the information I collect, including:

- **Encryption:** All data transmitted between your device and my servers is encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Access Control:** Access to logged IP addresses and location data is restricted to myself or authorized personnel only, ensuring it is only accessed for necessary tasks.
- **Data Anonymization:** Location data is anonymized before storage to ensure it cannot be traced back to any individual user.

## Sharing Your Information

I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. However, I may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated usage statistics, with third parties for purposes like improving the service or conducting research.

## Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:

- **Access:** Request access to the data I hold about you.
- **Correction:** Request corrections to any inaccurate data I hold about you.
- **Deletion:** Request the deletion of your data, subject to my retention policies for security and legal reasons.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact me at the information provided below.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in practices or legal obligations. When I do, the effective date at the top of this page will be revised. I encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how I protect your information.
